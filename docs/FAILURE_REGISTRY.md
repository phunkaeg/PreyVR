## F-001 — Frida CModule callback at DXGI Present

- **Date:** 2026-07-31
- **Target:** `Prey.exe` 1.0.1.0 / `PreyDll.dll` SHA-256 `7D6E322F61B28331095A400F0BA5F09BD9A39C57BF993602285DD6ACB05311A7`
- **Intent:** Count Present calls and capture the immediate return address without running JavaScript on the render thread.
- **Mechanism:** A temporary Frida `CModule` callback attached to the system `IDXGISwapChain::Present` implementation while the interactive execution thread waited.
- **Result:** `Prey.exe` crashed with exception `0xC0000005`; Windows reported an unknown faulting module / `StackHash_1030`. A local dump was written to `C:\Users\meise\AppData\Local\CrashDumps\Prey.exe.485216.dmp`.
- **Likely mechanism:** Callback or listener lifetime became invalid while the interactive Frida execution/session was blocked or torn down. This is an inference from the unknown/freed-code fault region, not a symbolized dump result.
- **Rule:** Do not use temporary CModule/Promise-based hooks through this MCP's interactive execution surface for frame-frequency functions. Use an externally-owned persistent tracer or Cheat Engine's non-breaking logging hardware breakpoint.
- **Recovery:** Relaunch Prey; no on-disk game files or save files were modified.

## F-002 — ReGenny `+N` is a relative delta, not an absolute offset

- **Date:** 2026-08-01
- **Target:** `regenny/PreyVR.genny` against `Prey.exe` / `PreyDll.dll` SHA-256 `7D6E322F…B05311A7`
- **Intent:** Overlay the renderer singleton and the per-frame view block using absolute struct offsets taken from Ghidra.
- **Mechanism:** Fields were written as `IDXGISwapChain* swapchain +0xAE88`, matching the absolute-offset reading implied by ReGenny's own `AGENT.md` example.
- **Result:** In this ReGenny build, `+N` places a field **N bytes after the previous field's end**. Offsets accumulate. The original `PreyRendererGraphics` therefore resolved `swapchain` to `+0xAE90`, `device` to `+0x15DC0`, `context_related_interface` to `+0x20D08`, `device_mirror` to `+0x2BCA8`, and `swapchain_mirror` to `+0x36C58`. An overlay read of a camera position returned `(-1635.07, -7952.76, 6753.18)` where direct arithmetic at the same offset returned `(783.58, 1573.48, 17.10)`.
- **Why it went unnoticed:** This defect was present in the notebook from the start. Every earlier finding came from x64dbg, Cheat Engine, or explicit Lua address arithmetic, so no overlay value was ever read back and compared. `regenny_list_types` also reports a struct size that is the sum of all field ends, which looks anomalous but was not investigated.
- **Rule:** Write every `.genny` field offset as a delta from the previous field's end, keep fields in ascending absolute order, and record the intended absolute offset in a trailing comment. **Never trust an overlay value until it has been diffed against a direct `p:read_*` at the same absolute address.** A silently wrong overlay is worse than no overlay, because it produces plausible-looking numbers.
- **Recovery:** All three structs were rewritten with correct deltas and a prominent syntax warning at the top of the file, then verified field-by-field: 21 of 21 overlay reads matched direct arithmetic exactly. No finding in `RESEARCH_LOG.md` was affected, because none was obtained through an overlay.
